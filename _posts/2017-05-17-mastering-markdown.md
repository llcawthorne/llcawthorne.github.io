Well, for something a little different, I decided to write my opinion of a 
free video course.  Since I'm writing my blog in markdown, I figured why 
not review it with something other than the Kramdown cheatsheet.
[Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/)
has a number of video courses, some free and some paid for.  His 
[Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) course is one of the free 
ones.  It's really only a single 23 minute video, so not much of a course, but 
since he just came out with a Learn Node course and has another longer free 
course of Javascript projects, I figured why not try the little course to get 
a feel for his teaching style and see if I want to invest any more time 
and/or money in more of
his courses later.  His other free courses if your interested include
[Command Line Power User](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/) which has some
Z shell tips that I might check out, since I'm sure I'm not making the most 
of it, and [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)
which is 30 days of building 
30 things in vanilla JS (which promises no frameworks, no compilers, no 
libraries, and no boilerplate).  Unless this one is terribly, I'll probably 
sit through the command line one after this.  The JavaScript 30 one I'll 
only invest time in if I like these two.  Well, without further ado, here's 
my opinion of [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/).

Good to see that he isn't opinionated about editors.  He says use whatever 
editor your most comfortable with, even vim.  He uses Sublime Text though 
and recommends a package for it, if you use it.  I went ahead and installed
it in my copy of Sublime Text.  It's called MarkdownEditing and has a lot
more features than the built in Sublime Markdown package.  I spent almost 
as much time reading the Package Control Messages as the runtime of these 
videos, but oh well, sometimes I open stuff up in Sublime, so I might as 
well get it working alright.  I took this chance to toggle some settings
in vim-markdown while I was thinking about it.

It's a little annoying that his video player jumps down to the video list
when it advances videos.  Each one, I have to scroll back up after it 
advances to see the video again.  Probably wouldn't be so bad on my big 
monitor instead of the laptop screen.  It's made even more annoying by how
short the videos are. Video quality is good, and it is nice that it saves
the fact that I've set the speed up to 1.25 when it switches videos.  I 
learned something about footnote links that I had forgotten, and a cool 
feature that lets you highlight a code block as a diff, so it wasn't
time wasted.  He talks a little fast anyway, so I probably wouldn't need
the speed increase for something that I didn't already know.

Overall, I thought the video was OK.  I'll try the 
[Command Line Power User](http://commandlinepoweruser/) course too and see
what I think of it.  Currently I just use zshell with oh-my-zsh and a 
couple of plugins enabled, so maybe I can learn some more zshell tricks.
