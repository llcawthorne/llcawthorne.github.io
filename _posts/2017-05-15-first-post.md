Finally got around to putting something together for my github.io site other
than what the generator spit out.  I went ahead and took advantage of the fact
that they let you layout your site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to play
with some new to me tech.  I can write up the posts in Markdown, so maybe it
will be easy enough that I actually start blogging here.
