	<h1>Hi there, I'm Lewis Cawthorne!</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a software developer for <a href="http://www.exlservice.com">EXL</a>
		working in Columbia, SC.  We have a small Java shop on main street 
		that develops applications used by off-shore labor, like 
		<a href="https://www.subrosource.com/">Subrosource</a>.  I'm currently
		technical lead for development of the Subrosource platform, which is
		my shop's largest application.
	</p>
	<p>
		My long term goal is to relocate to Raleigh, NC where my nephews live.
		Given my choice, I'ld probably find a nice job there coding in Python
		or Ruby instead of continuing to work with Java.  Maybe for Red Hat, since
		I do love me some Linux, but I'm pretty open to other opportunities.
	</p>
