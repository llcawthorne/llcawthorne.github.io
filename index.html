	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Lewis Cawthorne</span>.
		Welcome to my new homepage and blog.  I've just started this to play
		around with Jekyll, but I may try keeping it up to date with new
		entries.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm a software developer for <a href="http://www.exlservice.com">EXL</a>
		working in Columbia, SC.  We have a small Java shop on main street 
		that develops applications used by off-shore labor, like 
		<a href="https://www.subrosource.com/">Subrosource</a>.  I'm currently
		technical lead for development of the Subrosource platform, which is
		my shop's largest application.
	</p>
	<p>
		My long term goal is to relocate to Raleigh, NC where my nephews live.
		Given my choice, I'ld probably find a nice job there coding in Python
		or Ruby, or I could continue to work with Java.  Maybe for Red Hat, 
		since I do love me some Linux, but I'm pretty open to other opportunities
		that relocate me to the right area.
