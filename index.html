	<h1>Lewis Cawthorne's Homepage</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to my new homepage and blog.  I've just started this to play
		around with Jekyll, but I may end up keeping it up to date with new
		entries.  If you're interested in who I am, check out the
		<a href="/about">About Me</a> page.  If your interested in what I
		do, I'ld recommend the <a href="github.com/llcawthorne">Github link</a>.
		For some of my general thoughts and observations, checkout my 
		<a href="/blog">blog</a>.
