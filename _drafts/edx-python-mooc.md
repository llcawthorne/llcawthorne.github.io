I've been meaning to review my Python anyway, so I signed up for the EDX
Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python MOOC.  After
all, I was enjoying the software engineering MOOC.  This one is targetted
at beginners so may be a little slow, but then again, it is MIT, so who
knows.

The course materials are updated for Python 3.  Good!  They recommend the
Anaconda distribution of Python, which seems to be a data science platform.
I'll go ahead and uninstall my homebrew Python 3, so I don't confuse the two.

So many easy questions!
