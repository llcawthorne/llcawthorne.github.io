Well, for something a little different, I decided to write my opinion of a free 
video course.  Since I'm writing my blog in markdown, I figured why not review 
it with something other than the Kramdown cheatsheet.  Wes Bos has a number of 
video courses, some free and some paid for.  His 
[Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) course is one of the free 
ones.  It's really only a single 23 minute video, so not much of a course, but 
since he just came out with a Learn Node course and has another longer free 
course of Javascript projects, I figured why not try the little course to get 
a feel for his teaching style and see if I want to invest any more time 
and/or money in more of
his courses later.  His other free courses if your interested include
[Command Line Power User](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/) which has some
Z shell tips that I might check out, since I'm sure I'm not making the most of it, 
and [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) which is 30 days of building 
30 things in vanilla JS (which promises no frameworks, no compilers, no 
libraries, and no boilerplate).  Unless this one is terribly, I'll probably 
sit through the command line one after this.  The JavaScript 30 one I'll only
invest time in if I like these two.  Well, without further ado, here's my 
opinion of [Mastering Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/).
