I've never really done one of these MOOC's all the way through.  I did a
decent bit of the first scala MOOC through Coursera, but then never put
in the time to figure out how to do the first homework in a functional style.
Perhaps I enrolled in that one too close to after being in my Master's
degree, because I think I felt I needed a break from lectures.

They state up front that it's really a course about agile development that 
happens to use Rails, rather than a Rails specific course.

They believe you need to trust the process and use all the tools that
comprise agile development.

The key goal of the course is to teach "Agile Development" and other
"Software Engineering Principles".

It has a textbook.
"Engineering Software as a Service: An Agile Approach Using Cloud Computing".
It's only $9.95 on Kindle, so I might pick it up, depending upon what I
think of the course material.

AKA DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.

One of the quiz questions highlights that the big difference between Agile
and former Plan-and-Document techniques is measuring progress against a
plan (ie. you don't measure progress against a plan in Agile methodologies).
Why does it seem like my Agile team is still so plan driven?

Scrum involves teams of 4 to 9 people.  They have daily standup meetings
of about 15 minutes.  Work in "sprints" of 2-4 weeks.  Special roles are
Product Owner and Scrum Master.

In the course, they expect Pair Programming.  They have a setup for remote
pair programming with optional video and screensharing.

Facts about Ruby.  a.b always means call method b on receiver a.
Most operators are actually instance methods.
Everything is an object.  Ruby is a dynamic language.  Objects have types
but variables do not.
