So, I fixed my mistake from last time.  I had originally installed ruby via 
homebrew, but now that I've read up on rbenv, it seems a lot nicer than the
old rvm, and I might want multiple versions of Ruby on my home PC.  So I 
uninstalled Ruby 2.4 and went with `brew install rbenv` and then used
it to install the latest Ruby.  I see why the book authors prefer it over
RVM now.  Building Ruby from scratch sure is a lot slower than a binary
install though.

Anyway, on with Chapter 2, "Instant Gratification".
