So, what do I have to blog about?  I'm always trying out new stuff and reading
books, so I figure I'll talk about that.  I happen to have just gotten a 
beta copy of 
[Agile Web Development with Rails 5.1]
(https://pragprog.com/book/rails51/agile-web-development-with-rails-5-1)
and since my Ruby and Rails 
experience from my r&eacute;sum&eacute; is a little rusty, I figure I'll
read that and blog about the experience.  Starting this site using Jekyll
has made me think about Ruby lately anyway.  It's been many years since I've 
read "Agile Web Development with Rails", and I think it was the version that
covered Rails 1.2, so this should be a pretty new experience for me; both a 
great refresher and an introduction to what is new in the Rails world these
days.
